# Set-assignment
Made using Python 3.8
Running the Python file 'SET.py' will pop up the Tkinter window, and you can press start to display the buttons. 
Unfortunately this game is not playable. I tried really hard, watched a lot of tutorials, and I did learn a decent amount, but did not quite crack it. 

enjoy!
